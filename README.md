HOW TO USE: Open the project in VSCode and click "Debug and Run." After it opens a tab in your web browser, go to the debug console and look around through the white text until you find the URL with "HTTP" at the beginning of it instead of "HTTPS," and copy it into an API Platform such as Postman. After pasting it, add "AskingQuestions/asking/{name}/{time}," but type your name and the time you woke up that morning instead of {name} and {time}. After you type this, hit enter, and you should see a message with your inputs printed to the screen.

Peer Review: Marcel R. Program ran smooth, took two strings as name and time and output a message saying the name and time woke up. It also had a nice message :)
